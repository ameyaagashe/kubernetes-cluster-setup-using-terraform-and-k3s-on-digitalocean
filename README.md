# Set up HA k3s cluster on DigitalOcean using Terraform + Ansible

This demo aims to emonstrate how we can use set up your our Kubernetes cluster using lightweight Kubernetes distribution called [k3s](https://k3s.io) on DigitalOcean using IAC principle with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com).
